## Urban gravel?

I'm always remarking how much character the side streets of Hamilton have, and how lush even the laneways are. They're an amazing parallel to all the amazing rail trails the city has to offer.

I decided to take my camera with me on a ride around and capture a few.

They're not always rugged, or natural, but there's almost always a beautiful canopy above.
